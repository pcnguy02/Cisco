# Traffic Mirroring and SPAN Info  
Switches segement networks, and, as a result, limit the amount of traffic visible to network monitoring devices. However, it is important to monitor all traffic. Special techniques must be used to bypass segmentation from network switches. Port mirroring is one technique
supported by many enterprise switches. It enables the switch to copy frames that are received on one or more ports to a Switch Port Analyzer (SPAN) that is connected to an analysis device.
